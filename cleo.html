        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>
          Ever since I was a child, I've always like playing video games especially shooting games. That's why I got hooked in games like Crossfire, CS:GO, Valorant, Farlight 84, and Apex Legends.

          I watch a lot of anime on my free time or when I'm trying to rest up. I enjoy watching anime over reading manga because the action are more clear in anime unlike in manga where you need to imagine which I'm not really good at.
